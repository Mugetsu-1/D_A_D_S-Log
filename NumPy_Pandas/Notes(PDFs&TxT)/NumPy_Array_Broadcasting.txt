Array Broadcasting – SYNTAX and Summary

SYNTAX:
Result = array1 ⊕ array2
(⊕ = any element-wise operation: +, –, *, /, **, etc.)
Broadcasting applies when shapes are compatible.

Broadcasting Rules:

1. Compare shapes from right to left.
2. Dimensions match if they are equal or one of them is 1.
3. If compatible, NumPy virtually expands the smaller array.

Examples:
A + B
• A shape: (3, 1)
• B shape: (1, 4)
Broadcast result shape: (3, 4)

Common Broadcasting Patterns:

1. Scalar broadcast
   SYNTAX: array + scalar

2. Row/column broadcast
   SYNTAX: array + row_vector
   SYNTAX: array + column_vector

3. Dimension expansion for broadcast
   SYNTAX: array[:, np.newaxis]
   SYNTAX: array[np.newaxis, :]

Summary:

Array Broadcasting → Automatically expands smaller arrays to match larger ones for element-wise operations.
Used for → Fast math, vectorization, avoiding loops and copies.
