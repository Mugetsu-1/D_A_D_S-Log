# Loops - We use loops to repeatedly execute a block of code multiple times
# There are 2 types of loops in python. 
# For , While

# For loop is used when we already know the start and end point
# While loop is used when we dont know the stop condition 

# list = [1,2,3,4,5,"Ujjwal","Neupane"]
# for i in list:
#     print(i)
    
# tuple = (1,2,4,5,6)
# for i in tuple:
#     print(i)
    
# set = {1,2,3}
# for i in set:
#     print(i)
    
# Iterator - Iterator is a variable that stores the current value 
# Iterable - Iterable is a group data type where a loop is being executed
# Iteration - One single round of a loop is called iteration.

# range() - it generates the data from start_point, end_point, step
# Start value is always inclusive
# End value is always exclusive

# 1 value in range() - End value
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)
    
# 2 values in range() - Start and End
# for i in range(5,12):
#     print(i)
    
# 3 values in range() - Start, End, Step
# for i in range(1,20,3):
#     print(i)
